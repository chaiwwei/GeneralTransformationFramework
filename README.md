# Introduction
This project illustrates a transformation function designed to solve false-tie. The solution is shortened as FTF (false-tie transformation function). This project is a pure java project.

# Alternatives
-NTF (Normal Transformation Function [1]), the code-level implementation is in ot.StringTransformer.cs
-Alto (Address Space Transformation Optimization [2]), the code-level implementation is in ast.AST.cs

# Run Project
Enter bin directory, click a .bat file, and then the project would automatically run.

Several predefined simulated environments are provided by the .bat files.
